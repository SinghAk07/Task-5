Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Objective:
To capture live packets from an active network interface, identify basic protocols, and understand traffic flow using Wireshark.

Analyzed PCAP File:
File: merged.pcap

Protocols Identified:
1. TCP - Connection-oriented protocol used in web and application communications.
2. UDP - Lightweight, connectionless protocol used in fast data transfers like DNS.
3. DNS - Used to resolve domain names into IP addresses.
4. TLS/HTTPS - Secure communication observed through TLS handshakes.
5. ICMP - If ping tests were used, ICMP traffic would be visible.

Key Observations:
- TCP handshakes (SYN, ACK) seen.
- DNS queries to resolve domain names.
- TLS handshakes show encrypted HTTPS traffic.
- Local and public IPs detected.

Sample Packet Summary (First Few Packets):
Src IP           | Dest IP         | Protocol | Length (bytes)
---------------------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.23      | 8.8.8.8         | DNS      | 74
192.168.3.45      | 142.x.x.x       | TCP      | 66
142.164.34.12     | 192.168.x.x     | TCP      | 60
192.168.1.23      | 142.x.x.x       | TLS      | 125


Summary:
Wireshark effectively captured and filtered real-time traffic, providing insight into basic network protocols. This task helps improve packet analysis and network troubleshooting skills.
